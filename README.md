# Dictionaries for normalizing drug names to a single generic drug name

There are two JSON files with dictionaries with a single generic drug name as keys and the alternative generic names and brand names as the values belonging to the key. 

One JSON file contains such a dictionary without repeats in the values whereas the other still has the repeats within the values. 

The Jupyter script for generating these dictionaries is included.
